# StoryTellingGame
This is a story telling game, much on the lines of "Dungeons and Dragons". The user can control the flow of the story.
This is a very simple beginner project that has just one single file. 
It uses the concepts of:
i. Control flows (if, elif and else statements)
ii. Loops
iii. Functions
It uses just one simple library module called "os".
